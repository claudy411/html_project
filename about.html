                We are a national non-profit organization, our only benefit is the satisfaction of changing the lives of some
                animals. We know that we cannot reach everyone, the number of abandoned and abused animals that exist is
                inabable, but the important thing is to focus on how we can help those who can be reached, little by
                little, with a lot of effort and, above all, with your support, we can grow and help many more.
            </div><br>

                An important part of our family are our little furries, they are in one way or another those who pushed
                us to create ASA â€“ Association for Animal Sensitivity. We want to help those who, unlike our own, have
                no family and sometimes their lives are hanging by a thread. We know that the task is difficult and that
                it is not always achieved, but when a little one finds his home, the warmth of a friendly hand makes the
                struggle and suffering worthwhile.

            <div>
                Thus we are born, from the illusion of a group of people eager to work for and for them. We started
                little by little, but working hard in the hope of being able to rescue a large number of animals. Thanks
                to the efforts of the volunteers and the friends that we have been meeting on the road every day there
                are many animals that have found family.
